# Rails Girls 2015

The **to-do list** app was created at Rails Girls 2015 in Cracow to show my participants how to build Rails applications. There's also a fancy feature to close or open tasks.

To setup the project locally clone this repository and type `bundle exec rake db:migrate`. If you want to create an application from scratch you may do it on [lite.nitrous.io](https://lite.nitrous.io) without setting up your own environment.

If you are interested in the game **Ruby Warrior** it's worth to visit [this blog](http://www.iconoclastlabs.com/blog/ruby-warrior-walkthrough-part-1) (especially in case when you can't figure out a solution).
